    <p>When disaster strikes, first responders need to know what areas have been hit the hardest and what resources are available to help—without delay.  To meet this urgent need, the Global Agenda Council on Space is leading the development of <b>HelpNow™</b>, a free, open-source web tool that uses the power of space technologies to deliver accurate, up-to-date information rapidly to humanitarian relief efforts.</p>
    <p>HelpNow integrates data from imaging satellites, communication networks and GPS as well as aid organizations and social media. From this data, the software generates a simple, map-based user interface that displays critical disaster-relief information using intuitive icons.  In combination with this interface, HelpNow’s algorithm enables the user to match the needs of victims quickly to available resources. The software’s icon-based interface will allow users to choose between multiple languages. When widely used, HelpNow will help response teams and NGOs combine their strengths to reach more victims faster. </p>
    <p>HelpNow will be offered free to governments, NGOs, and individuals. The software uses an open-source platform that makes it easy to incorporate additional plug-ins or apps. HelpNow is designed without proprietary information and is easy to integrate with existing humanitarian systems – facilitating collaboration and feature development. Critical data will be safeguarded with controlled access via permission-level logins.</p>
    <p>HelpNow is a project initiated by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Global Agenda Council for Space (GAC-S) to improve safety, security and quality of life worldwide through the use of space-enabled technologies. The effort began when the chair of the Global Agenda Council on Space, Rick Ambrose of Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, assembled a development team from Digital Globe, CauseLabs and Lockheed Martin. Satellite Application Catapult UK also helped refine the requirements for the tool’s initial release. A select team from Lockheed Martin is now developing the software, incorporating input from experts in the field of humanitarian aid.</p>
    <p>The initial HelpNow prototype, v0.1, demonstrates proof of concept and is available at: <a href="http://ec2-52-35-71-10.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com">http://ec2-52-35-71-10.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com</a>. The first version of the tool, v1.0, will be available for use in June 2016. The site chosen for initial testing of HelpNow is Bangladesh, a nation challenged by severe seasonal flooding.</p>
